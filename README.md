# Maze-Solver

This code navigates the robot from a user-defined start location to a user defined goal location in a pre-defined maze. The maze is pre-defined, and stored in a text file.

The path is traced recursively. The program prints the final path in the maze. If the path is not found for a particular case, output is dispayed accordingly.
